# Jake-the-lawman-game
My submission for the techXR hackathon, in which I secured under 10 rank among 3500+ submissions

I made this game passionately and under just 2 days!!
The story for this is I already made a previous unity game, titled "Food Run". In this game, you play as a sphere entity in a kitchen inspired setting, with kitchen tables, chairs, refrigerators, ovens, sink etc. Various food items are scattered in this setting and the player has to collect them.

The catch is that you can select which type of food you collect!
There are 2 types of food, good one and bad one...and based on the food collected you can have either of the 3 predefined endings!!! Cool, isn't it?

Well, I submitted this game and lo and behold, after few hours, there comes a notification that the submission date has been extended to 2 more days...

Now, Food Run was a pretty good game, but it lacked two thing...graphics and a good player character...
I could revamp these 2 things in the 2 days, i thought to myself, and hence asked the supervisors if i could resubmit my project...they said yes!

Therefore I made some player character changes, and one thing led to another and I completely revamped my game and made a GTA style sandbox game, where you play as a cop named "Jake" and you shoot and catch criminals, and the money they looted.

The game looked way better, cartoonish asthetics but pretty to its core.

Submitted it and after a week or so, much to my anticipation....I didn't win the hackathon :(
But one good thing nonetheless happened...
I secured a position in the top 10!!
Holy smokes! This was an amazing feeling in and of itself, and felt really great...

Not just this, I also got an internship offer from them, with stipend and hostel charges fully paid!
Sadly, I had to decline for some reasons, but nonetheless this was an experience.

Tl;dr: I remade a game in 2 days and got in the top 10 among 3500+ submissions
